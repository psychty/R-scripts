# Intro

paste0("The capacity to understand and forecast future demand has increasingly been seen as an important component of commissioning as an activity across health and social care. The Projecting Older People Population Information System (POPPI) is database is a user-friendly, practical and straightforward way to analyse population data, identify key characteristics within that population, project numbers into the future, and compare future populations against performance data. POPPI was originally developed by the Institute of Public Care (IPC) for the Care Services Efficiency Delivery Programme (CSED). The system is now provided solely by the Institute of Public Care on licence from the Department of Health.")

paste0("The system applies assumptions about conditions at national prevalence levels to local population estimates and projections. Currently the POPPI system uses the 2014 based population projections by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ONS has since published 2016 based population projections. The updated projections give a slightly more conservative estimate of the increases expected later in the projections (beyond the next decade) and particularly affect projections for older old age groups. Based on the 2014 projections used in the POPPI system, it is anticipated that by 2035, there will be 109,400 over 65's living alone, whereas the same assumptions applied to the 2016 projections anticipate that there will be 105,800 over 65's living alone, a reduction in over 3,500 residents.")

POPPI_site_ill_health <- data.frame(Age = c("65+","65+","65+","65+","75+","65+","65+","65+","65+","65+","65+"), Condition = c("Diabetes", "Dementia", "Depression", "Severe Depression", "Registrable eye conditions", "Severe hearing loss", "Bronchitis and emphysema", "Longstanding health condition caused by a stroke", "Bladder problem at least once a week", "Fall", "Admission to hospital as a result of a fall"), Number = c(24100,14600,16800,5300,5900,16200,3250,4500,32500,52700,4100))

paste0("We know that projecting ill health in this way has a number of issues. First, as with all projections, they are best guesses based on applying prevalence rates nationally to local populations, which assumes West Sussex population is similar to England overall in terms of its characteristics. Second, the assumptions applied are likely to be from out of date national surveys more than a decade old. Third, POPPI uses 2014 based ONS projections, whilst more recent (2016 based) are publically available. ONS projections are largely based on trends seen in the previous five years, and so can change quite significantly every release. Whichever year ONS projections, they do not include additional information on local housing policies and housing stock decisions, which local authorities often produce to augment the ONS release.")

paste0("The method used for POPPI based estimates is to apply what we know about a disease prevalence to the number of people expected to be living in West Sussex in the future. This assumes that prevalence rates will remain the same (e.g. the same percentage of people will develop a condition in 2018 and in 2038. This is unlikely to be the case with developments in preventative treatments, diagnostic improvements and education around risk factors.")

paste0("Current epidemiological work indicates that the risk factors observed in those who were younger adults in the past (now aged 65+) are different to those who are younger adults now (to be aged 65+ in the future). As such, it is difficult to conclude that generations of older people in the future will experience ill health in the same way as older people now.")

paste0("Instead, we would be more accurate in attempting to apply what we think the prevalence of a condition or conditions will be like in the future, and then apply that figure to the estimated population projection.")

paste0("A second fundamental issue is the measurement of co-morbidities, which is increasingly receiving traction among commentators as the necessary paradigm shift required to address health and social care in the future (Kingston et al, 2018).")

paste0("There are several steps to this work. First we try to assess the current prevalence of health conditions and multi morbidity among older people in West Sussex, then we look to project what the morbidity landscape of older people in West Sussex could look like in the future.")

# Although multi-morbidity (presence of multiple chronic (long-term) conditions) has been researched extensively, there is currently no consensus on its precise definition. The number, type (physical or mental health) and selection criteria for conditions included in multi-morbidity indices vary from one author to another. For example, while Salisbury et. al., (2011) defined multi-morbidity as the presence of more than one chronic condition, Barnett et. al., (2012) defined it as the presence of two or more. 

# In addition, both authors also differ in terms of their selection criteria. While the former focused on conditions listed in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) and a much wider list of chronic conditions identified using the Johns Hopkins University Adjusted Clinical Groups Case-Mix System, the latter considered diseases included in the QOF, conditions recommended in a systematic review and long-term disorders identified as important by NHS Scotland.

# The study (https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/47/3/374/4815738) aims o project the future burden of multi-morbidity among older adults using stochastic microsimulation of younger cohorts in England from a 1% random sample of the Understanding Society, English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II.

# This analysis takes the prevalence assumptions from this study and applies it to the population projections for West Sussex.

# The limitations of this are that it assumes the population of west sussex will be the same as the national population used as a sample in the research paper. Also whilst the populations take into account recent local housing stock decisions, it does not take into future policy decisions or decisions that have not taken affect (including Brexit).
